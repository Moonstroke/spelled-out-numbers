# Spelled-out numbers

## Locale-aware representation of numbers as text

This project provides a
[`Number`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Number.html)
subclass embodying a textual representation of a number, in a specified locale.

It is mostly a pretext for me to get a handle on the
[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface) feature.
